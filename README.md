## T5X

T5X is a modular, composable, research-friendly framework for high-performance,
configurable, self-service training, evaluation, and inference of sequence
models (starting with language) at many scales.

It is essentially a new and improved implementation of the
[T5 codebase](https://github.com/google-research/text-to-text-transfer-transformer)
(based on Mesh TensorFlow) in JAX and Flax.
